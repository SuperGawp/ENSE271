# Lab 1 - Assignment 

Below are the extra features which I tried: 
 - For each status (that has a colour of grey, green and blue) I changed the colour of the cards to match their respective status. 
 - I added a persona by the name of 'Julie' who has the role of a student as this class schedule is not only meant for me, but for fellow 
   classmates who would like an idea on how to organise their schedule. 

 - Under ENSE271, for "Read Syllabus" I decided to add an unordered list in it's description. 
 - Under ENSE271, for "Read Text" I decided to add an ordered list in it's description. 
 - Under ENSE271, for 'go through notes..." I decided to add an unordered list.
 - Under CS350, for "tim horton's before class" I decided to add a Strikethrough and an unordered list in it's description. 
 - For CS 215's description I decided to add an unordered list to explain how the class hadn't started yet and when it would start.
 - Annotations were also added to the ENSE271 group project card.  
 - Headers were added to the epic cards
 - Italics were added to the walking bones
